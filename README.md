# PhishingDetector

Phishing Detector is a project of the LMU Munich in cooperation with the Bundeswehr University, which was developed in the context of a master thesis. The aim is to test whether the spatial proximity of warnings has an influence on user behavior, and whether there are properties that improve or worsen this behavior.
