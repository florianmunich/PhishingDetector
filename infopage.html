        Phishing Detector is a project of the LMU Munich in cooperation with the Bundeswehr University, which was developed in the context of a master thesis.
        The aim is to test whether the spatial proximity of warnings has an influence on user behavior, and whether there are properties that improve or worsen this behavior.
        The master thesis is written by Florian Hartl, the supervisors are M.Sc. Felix Dietz and Dr. Pascal Knierim. The thesis will be titled "Development and Evaluation of a Browser Plugin To Prevent Social Engineering Attacks".

          <span class="a">If a web page is not known by your browser's version of PhishingDetector, a virus scan is requested. If the page was never scanned before, we request a scan by Virustotal which initiates a scan by multiple detectors. After this scan the result is returned to the plugin. Until all this is processed, the icon's color will be yellow. You can retrieve information about the current status that will be updated once the scan results are ready.</span>
