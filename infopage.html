                    <p>
                        Phishing Detector is a project of the LMU Munich in
                        cooperation with the Bundeswehr University, which was
                        developed in the context of a master thesis. The aim is
                        to test whether the spatial proximity of warnings has an
                        influence on user behavior, and whether there are
                        properties that improve or worsen this behavior. The
                        master thesis is written by Florian Hartl, the
                        supervisors are M.Sc. Felix Dietz and Dr. Pascal
                        Knierim. The thesis will be titled "Development and
                        Evaluation of a Browser Plugin To Prevent Social
                        Engineering Attacks".

                    <div class="infoText">
                        PhishingDetector scans the domain of every page you
                        visit. Then it matches whether the domain is in a white-
                        or blacklist of websites that we obtain from Mendeley.
                        The origin of the files is a
                        <a
                            href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/n96ncsr5g4/1"

                            >Mendeley Data Set</a
                        >. For websites that are not in these lists, we request
                        an analysis from
                        <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/" target="_blank"
                            >Virustotal.com</a
                        >
                        for the domain. This site scans websites with about 80
                        virus scanners and returns the result. If more than one
                        scan finds the website to be malicious, we create a
                        warning. You can then decide for yourself in the pop-up
                        window whether you trust the scan or classify the site
                        as safe.

                            As part of the study, we store data that the tool
                            creates. For example, injections of the icon, scans
                            of pages and behavior when displaying the injected

                            particular, web pages are also shortened to their
                            domains, i.e. they are not transmitted in full (for

                            only www.facebook.com is stored). Should the
                            functionality be disabled, no further data will be
                            collected or shared. The last insertion of the
                            PDIcon and the known Domains are always saved, but
                            only transferred if the option is set. Under no

                            detectors. After this scan the result is returned to
