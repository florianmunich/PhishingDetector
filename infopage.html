          <p>
            Phishing Detector is a project of the LMU Munich in cooperation with
            the Bundeswehr University, which was developed in the context of a
            master thesis. The aim is to test whether the spatial proximity of
            warnings has an influence on user behavior, and whether there are
            properties that improve or worsen this behavior. The master thesis
            is written by Florian Hartl, the supervisors are M.Sc. Felix Dietz
            and Dr. Pascal Knierim. The thesis will be titled "Development and
            Evaluation of a Browser Plugin To Prevent Social Engineering
            Attacks".

          <div class="infoText">
            PhishingDetector scans the domain of every page you visit. Then it
            matches whether the domain is in a white- or blacklist of websites
            that we obtain from Mendeley. The origin of the files is a
            <a
              href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/n96ncsr5g4/1"
              target="_blank"
              >Mendeley Data Set</a
            >. For websites that are not in these lists, we request an analysis
            from
            <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/" target="_blank"
              >Virustotal.com</a
            >
            for the domain. This site scans websites with about 80 virus
            scanners and returns the result. If more than one scan finds the
            website to be malicious, we create a warning. You can then decide
            for yourself in the pop-up window whether you trust the scan or
            classify the site as safe.

              When entering the ProlificID, make sure to enter all characters
              without errors so that we can assign the contributions to your
              account. If you mistyped the Prolific ID, you can change it via
              the popup. But please note: If the ID is then deleted or entered
              incorrectly, we will assume that participation has been canceled.

              What data is shared with the developers?

            <p class="a">
              As part of the study, we store data that the tool creates. For
              example, injections of the icon, scans of pages and behavior when
              displaying the injected icon. All data is transferred anonymously.
              In particular, web pages are also shortened to their domains, i.e.
              they are not transmitted in full (for example, for
              https://www.facebook.com/martin.fischer only www.facebook.com is
              stored). Should the functionality be disabled, no further data
              will be collected or shared. The last insertion of the PDIcon and
              the known Domains are always saved, but only transferred if the
              option is set. Under no circumstances will information be
              published in the thesis that could indicate the identity of users.

            </summary>
            <p class="a">
              If a web page is not known by your browser's version of
              PhishingDetector, a virus scan is requested. If the page was never
              scanned before, we request a scan by Virustotal which initiates a
              scan by multiple detectors. After this scan the result is returned
              to the plugin. Until all this is processed, the icon's color will
              be yellow. You can retrieve information about the current status
              that will be updated once the scan results are ready.

              Why does the scan not work on some pages?
            </summary>
            <p class="a">
              On all public accessible pages the scan and the display of the
              icon should work without any problems. On system pages and files
              that are open locally, no analysis is performed and the icon
              remains yellow. If the volume of requests is too high, it may be
              that temporarily no new analyses can be retrieved. This error will
              fix itself after 24 hours at the latest.

              In some cases, a page cannot be classified by PhishingDetector.

              <li>The page was not opened with the plugin enabled</li>

              <li>The page contains a locally openned document</li>
